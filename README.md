# Depression-Analysis-using-Speech-and-Image
Depression is a common problem in our society. In this repo, I have trained a model for image and speech classification that will detect whether the person is Depressed or not. 
The Image Classifier.py contains the image classifier. The model is pretrained and ready for you. Comment out the lines that you don't require. 
The Audio Classifier.py contains the audio classifier. The model is pretrained.
